# Fonts

## Intro
This repo exists to store and save some of the fonts that I have found I like
to use over time. 

Specifically, this will include the Input Mono, and a few others for my Kindle
E-Reader. These fonts were downloaded from the Google Fonts page.

## Kindle Fonts
Steps to get the fonts up and running on the kindle include:
1) download fonts and unzip if necessary
2) grab the .ttl or true type fonts and drag them into the fonts file
   on the kindle, under the fonts directory.
3) All done! just go into settins on kindle and it should show up!

## A Word About Git
1) git add . (This will add all files in folder)
2) git commit -m "your message here" (will add message to each of the files)
   we can also use git commit -am. to commit all, with the message "." for 
   quick changes
4) git push (this will push to the set upstream branch)

git branch -M "branch name" (this will change the branch name and force)
