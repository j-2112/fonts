# Fonts

## Intro
This repo exists to store and save some of the fonts that I have found I like
to use over time. 

Specifically, this will include the Input Mono, and a few others for my Kindle
E-Reader. These fonts were downloaded from the Google Fonts page.

**Remember, to ==unzip these fonts and save them==**

`for x in range(10):
    print(yes)`
